# Remina's Stuff

This is my personal repositry.

The projects that are here range from simple class-task, minor projects and larger projects(done and ongoing)

ProgrammingADV is a mixture of class-tasks for my time studying at Axevalla Folkh√∂gskola with a bit of attempts at this years Advent of Code

Unity Branch is current and old projects made in Unity, with the old and "finished" being Kitchen Chaos and the current one is Axevalla Arkad.

The 3 zip files for Kitchen Chaos are different builds and my first project made in gamemaker, the first one being the Kitchen Chaos version without added multiplayer feature and the other being most updated(and WIP) with fully functional multiplayer and then later trying to add more customization options(this in turn ruined the ability to change color as changing the method of rendering the playable characters required rewriting of the code that handles serialzation of player data sent to the host and clients, resulting in only showing the base color). the last one is "Mofu survivors" and is simple Vampire survivors clone made in game maker.

Axevalla Akrad is the current project for my class, which is me trying to create a user friendly way for everyone in my class to put in their games and launching them indivudually through a cabinet. The whole project has been me experimenting with different methods of saving, launchng and storing data between games that later can be easily understood by someone who isn't me.

To test and launch the unity eidtor version of Kitchen Chaos, play the game from the main menu scene
